12. Write a programme to input any number and check if it is prime or not.
(Prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only. In other words,
prime numbers can't be divided by other numbers than itself or 1. For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,
17.... are the prime numbers.)
